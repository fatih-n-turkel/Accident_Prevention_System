# Accident_Prevention_System
Accident Prevention System like TESLA cars. (PCB + Code Design)

(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_svqTvp0FE) As shown in the video, TESLA vehicles prevent accidents by autonomously moving to the most suitable place when they suddenly encounter obstacles. This system has been simulated in this project. It can be used in hobby electronic devices. For example, if the vehicle is driving on a straight road and suddenly detects an obstacle from the left side, it will pass to the right (right corner) if the right side is available. If not, it will move to the most available place, otherwise it will stop.

In the hardware design, I got help from the open source designs of SparkFun.
